# How do you collaborate with other business functions within your organization? 
I'd like to understand how collaboration is approached across technology organizations today. In the survey, please include:
- **Who** you are? What is your title at your company?
- **What** other teams you and/or your team typically interact with to accomplish your goals
- **How** you and/or interact with other teams

## Why this form?
I will use form responses to get a better idea into how often teams across IT organizations actually work with one another. I'd also like to use this data to study how SMEs across functions can improve the way they engage with one another and use their engagement to further enhance the way they approach interacting with and building customer relationships.
