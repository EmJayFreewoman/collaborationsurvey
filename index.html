    <h1>How do you collaborate with other teams in your organization?</h1>
    <p>
      I am a community manager that simply enjoys bringing people together in a
      way that enables positive change. I'm curious how people inside IT
      organizations work with one another to accomplish their goals. Please
      answer the questions below to help me figure out how to create stronger
      communities across IT organizations, including people from all business
      functions, and their customers.
    </p>
